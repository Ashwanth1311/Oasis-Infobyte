#Task - 1 (Basic_voice assistant)
Create a basic voice assistant that can perform simple tasks based on voice commands. Implement features like responding to "Hello" and providing predefined responses, telling the time or date, and searching the web for information based on user queries.

#Key Concepts and Challenges:

1.Speech Recognition: Learn how to recognize and process voice commands using speech recognition libraries or APIs.

2.User Interaction: Create a user-friendly interaction design that allows users to communicate with the assistant via voice commands.

3.Error Handling: Handle potential issues with voice recognition, network requests, or task execution.
